This Android Project displays a list of top rated movies.  Selecting a top rated movie shows details of the selected movie alongside a list of similar movies.

Movie data is sourced from https://www.themoviedb.org/

Some of the technologies used are: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Jetpack Navigation, Jetpack Paging, Material 3, Retrofit, Kotlinx serialization and Koin.

## Building the Android App
A recent version of Android Studio is required to build the app.

The app requires an api authorisation key to access The Movie DB api.  This key must be added to apikeys.properties file in the root of the project, as below.

TMDB_API_TOKEN="eyJhbGci..."

In accordance with general standards no api key has been checked into the github repository.  The project will not build until an api key has been added to apikeys.properties.
